Rock,Rock/Pop,"London, England",Relaxed,"Fleetwood Mac are a British-American rock band formed in 1967 in London.
The only original member present in the band is its eponymous drummer, Mick Fleetwood. Despite band founder Peter Green naming the group by combining the surnames of two of his former bandmates (Fleetwood, McVie) from John Mayall's Bluesbreakers, bassist John McVie played neither on their first single nor at their first concerts. The keyboardist, Christine McVie, who joined the band in 1970 while married to John McVie, appeared on all but two albums, either as a member or as a session musician. She also supplied the artwork for the album Kiln House.
The two most successful periods for the band were during the late 1960s British blues boom, when they were led by guitarist Peter Green and achieved a UK number one with ""Albatross""; and from 1975 to 1987, with more pop-orientation, featuring Christine McVie, Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks. Fleetwood Mac's second album after the incorporation of Nicks and Buckingham, 1977's Rumours, produced four U.S. Top 10 singles (including Nicks' song ""Dreams"", which was the band's first and only U.S. number one) and remained at No.1 on the American albums chart for 31 weeks, as well as reaching the top spot in various countries around the world. To date the album has sold over 40 million copies worldwide, making it the eighth highest selling album of all time.
The band enjoyed more modest success in the intervening period between 1971 and 1974, with the line-up including Bob Welch, and also during the 1990s which saw more personnel changes before the return of Nicks and Buckingham in 1997, and more recently, the departure of Christine McVie."

Alternative Rock,Rock/Pop,"Abingdon, England",Sad,"Radiohead are an English rock band from Abingdon, Oxfordshire, formed in 1985. The band consists of Thom Yorke (lead vocals, guitar, piano), Jonny Greenwood (lead guitar, keyboards, other instruments), Colin Greenwood (bass), Phil Selway (drums, percussion) and Ed O'Brien (guitar, backing vocals).
Radiohead released their debut single ""Creep"" in 1992. The song was initially unsuccessful, but it became a worldwide hit several months after the release of their debut album, Pablo Honey (1993). Radiohead's popularity rose in the United Kingdom with the release of their second album, The Bends (1995). Radiohead's third album, OK Computer (1997), propelled them to greater international fame. Featuring an expansive sound and themes of modern alienation, OK Computer is often acclaimed as one of the landmark records of the 1990s.
Kid A (2000) and Amnesiac (2001) marked an evolution in Radiohead's musical style, as the group incorporated experimental electronic music, krautrock and jazz influences. Kid A, though somewhat polarizing at the time of its release, is now frequently recognized as one of the most important albums of the 2000s. Hail to the Thief (2003), a mix of piano and guitar driven rock, electronics and lyrics inspired by war, was the band's final album for their major record label, EMI. Radiohead self-released their seventh album, In Rainbows (2007), as a digital download for which customers could set their own price, and later in physical form to critical and chart success. Radiohead's eighth album, The King of Limbs (2011), was an exploration of rhythm and quieter textures, which the band released independently.
Radiohead have sold more than 30 million albums worldwide, with the band's work being placed highly in both listener polls and critics' lists, they have the distinction of doing so in both the 1990s and 2000s. In 2005, Radiohead were ranked number 73 in Rolling Stone's list of ""The Greatest Artists of All Time"", while Jonny Greenwood and Ed O'Brien were both included in Rolling Stone's list of greatest guitarists, and Thom Yorke in their list of greatest singers. In 2009, Rolling Stone readers voted the group the second best artist of the 2000s."

Alternative Rock,Rock/Pop,"Seattle, USA",Energetic,"Foo Fighters are an American rock band formed in 1994 in Seattle, Washington. The band was founded by former Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl as a one-man project following the dissolution of Nirvana after the suicide of Kurt Cobain. The group took its name from foo fighter, a nickname coined by Allied aircraft pilots for UFOs and other aerial phenomena. Over the course of their career, Foo Fighters have won 12 Grammy Awards, including Best Rock Album four times. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2021, their first year of eligibility.

Prior to the release of Foo Fighters' 1995 debut album Foo Fighters, which featured Grohl as the only official member, Grohl recruited bassist Nate Mendel and drummer William Goldsmith, both formerly of Sunny Day Real Estate, as well as Nirvana touring guitarist Pat Smear. The band began with performances in Portland, Oregon. Goldsmith quit during the recording of their second album The Colour and the Shape (1997); most of the drum parts were re-recorded by Grohl. Smear departed soon afterward but appeared as a guest with the band frequently from 2005; he rejoined in 2010.

Smear and Goldsmith were replaced by Franz Stahl and Taylor Hawkins; Stahl was fired before the recording of the group's third album, There Is Nothing Left to Lose (1999). The band briefly continued as a trio until Chris Shiflett joined on guitar after the completion of There Is Nothing Left to Lose. Foo Fighters released their fourth album, One by One, in 2002. It was followed with the two-disc In Your Honor (2005), which was split between acoustic songs and heavier material. Foo Fighters released their sixth album, Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace, in 2007.

For Foo Fighters' seventh studio album, Wasting Light (2011), produced by Butch Vig, Smear returned as a full member. Sonic Highways (2014) was released as the soundtrack to the television miniseries directed by Grohl. Concrete and Gold (2017) was the second Foo Fighters album to reach number one in the United States and their first studio album to feature longtime session and touring keyboardist Rami Jaffee as a full member. The band's tenth album, Medicine at Midnight (2021), was the last to feature Hawkins, who died in March 2022."
Rock,Rock/Pop,"Washington, USA",Sad,"Nirvana was an American rock band that was formed by singer and guitarist Kurt Cobain and bassist Krist Novoselic in Aberdeen, Washington, in 1987. Nirvana went through a succession of drummers, the longest-lasting being Dave Grohl, who joined the band in 1990. Despite releasing only three full-length studio albums in their seven-year career, Nirvana has come to be regarded as one of the most influential and important rock bands of the modern era.
In the late 1980s Nirvana established itself as part of the Seattle grunge scene, releasing its first album Bleach for the independent record label Sub Pop in 1989. The band eventually came to develop a sound that relied on dynamic contrasts, often between quiet verses and loud, heavy choruses. After signing to major label DGC Records, Nirvana found unexpected success with ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"", the first single from the band's second album Nevermind (1991). Nirvana's sudden success widely popularized alternative rock as a whole, and the band's frontman Cobain found himself referred to in the media as the ""spokesman of a generation"", with Nirvana being considered the ""flagship band"" of Generation X. In response, Nirvana's third studio album, In Utero (1993), featured an abrasive, less-mainstream sound and challenged the group's audience. The album did not match the sales figures of Nevermind, but was still a commercial success and critically acclaimed.
Nirvana's brief run ended following the death of Kurt Cobain in 1994, but various posthumous releases have been issued since, overseen by Novoselic, Grohl, and Cobain's widow Courtney Love. Since its debut, the band has sold over 25 million records in the United States alone, and over 75 million records worldwide, making them one of the best-selling bands of all time. Nirvana was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2014, in its first year of eligibility."
Pop,Rock/Pop,"New York, USA",Happy,"William Martin ""Billy"" Joel (born May 9, 1949, New York, USA) is an American pianist, singer-songwriter, and composer. Since releasing his first hit song, ""Piano Man"", in 1973, Joel has become the sixth-best-selling recording artist and the third-best-selling solo artist in the United States, according to the RIAA. His compilation album Greatest Hits Vol. 1 & 2 is the third-best-selling album in the United States by discs shipped.
Joel had Top 40 hits in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, achieving 33 Top 40 hits in the United States, all of which he wrote himself. He is also a six-time Grammy Award winner, a 23-time Grammy nominee and one of the world's best-selling artists of all time, having sold over 150 million records worldwide. He was inducted into the Songwriter's Hall of Fame (1992), the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (1999), and the Long Island Music Hall of Fame (2006). In 2008, Billboard magazine released a list of the Hot 100 All-Time Top Artists to celebrate the US singles chart's 50th anniversary, with Billy Joel positioned at No. 23. With the exception of the 2007 songs ""All My Life"" and ""Christmas in Fallujah"", Joel stopped writing and recording popular music after 1993's River of Dreams, but he continued to tour extensively until 2010. Joel was born in the Bronx, May 9, 1949 and raised in Hicksville, New York in a Levitt home. His father, Howard (born Helmuth), was born in Germany, the son of German merchant and manufacturer Karl Amson Joel, who, after the advent of the Nazi regime, emigrated to Switzerland and later to the United States. Billy Joel's mother, Rosalind Nyman, was born in England to Philip and Rebecca Nyman. Both of Joel's parents were Jewish. They divorced in 1960, and his father moved to Vienna, Austria. Billy has a sister, Judith Joel, and a half-brother, Alexander Joel, who is an acclaimed classical conductor in Europe and currently chief musical director of the Staatstheater Braunschweig.
Joel's father was an accomplished classical pianist. Billy reluctantly began piano lessons at an early age, at his mother's insistence; his teachers included the noted American pianist Morton Estrin and musician/songwriter Timothy Ford. His interest in music, rather than sports, was a source of teasing and bullying in his early years. (He has said in interviews that his piano instructor also taught ballet. Her name was Frances Neiman, and she was a Juilliard trained musician. She gave both classical piano and ballet lessons in the studio attached to the rear of her house, leading neighborhood bullies to mistakenly assume that he was learning to dance.) As a teenager, Joel took up boxing so that he would be able to defend himself. He boxed successfully on the amateur Golden Gloves circuit for a short time, winning twenty-two bouts, but abandoned the sport shortly after breaking his nose in his twenty-fourth boxing match.
Joel attended Hicksville High School in 1967, but he did not graduate with his class. He had been helping his single mother make ends meet by playing at a piano bar, which interfered with his school attendance. At the end of his senior year, Joel did not have enough credits to graduate. Rather than attend summer school to earn his diploma, however, Joel decided to immediately begin a career in music. Joel recounted, ""I told them, 'To hell with it. If I'm not going to Columbia University, I'm going to Columbia Records, and you don't need a high school diploma over there'."" Columbia did, in fact, become the label that eventually signed him. In 1992, he submitted essays to the school board and was awarded his diploma at Hicksville High's annual graduation ceremony, 25 years after he had left."
Rock,Rock/Pop,"Arkansas, USA",Troubled,"Evanescence is an American rock band founded in Little Rock, Arkansas in 1995 by singer/pianist Amy Lee and guitarist Ben Moody. After recording private albums, the band released their first full-length album, Fallen, on Wind-up Records in 2003. Fallen sold more than 15 million copies  worldwide and helped the band win two Grammy Awards and seven nominations, in addition, Fallen is #6 at the ""Top Bestselling albums of the last 10 Years"". A year later, Evanescence released their first live album, Anywhere but Home, which sold more than one million copies worldwide. In 2006, the band released their second studio album, The Open Door, which sold more than five million copies.

The line-up of the group has changed several times: David Hodges leaving in 2002, co-founder Moody left in 2003 (mid-tour), bassist Will Boyd in 2006, followed by guitarist John LeCompt and drummer Rocky Gray in 2007. The last two changes led to a hiatus, with temporary band members contributing to tour performances. Billboard ranked Evanescence #71 on the Best Artists of the Decade chart.

Announced in June 2009, the newest line-up of the band eventually returned with Evanescence, their self-titled third studio album, released on October 11, 2011. It debuted at #1 on the Billboard 200 chart with 127,000 copies in sales. According to Examiner.com, the album also debuted at #1 on four other different Billboard charts; the Rock Albums, Digital Albums, Alternative Albums, and the Hard Rock Albums charts. The first single, ""What You Want"", was released on August 9, 2011. The second single, ""My Heart Is Broken"", was sent to radio stations in October 31, 2011. The band is currently on tour in promotion of their new album with other bands including The Pretty Reckless and Fair to Midland.

Evanescence was founded by singer, pianist and songwriter Amy Lee and former lead guitarist and songwriter Ben Moody. The two met in 1994 at a youth camp in Little Rock, where Moody heard Lee playing ""I'd Do Anything for Love (But I Won't Do That)"" by Meat Loaf on the piano. Their first songs together were ""Solitude"" and ""Give Unto Me"", both written by Lee, and ""Understanding"" and ""My Immortal"", both written by Moody. The songs were edited by both artists, and they shared equal credit.

Two of Lee and Moody's songs were played on local radio stations, raising local awareness of the group and demand for a concert. The band eventually appeared live, and became one of the most popular acts in the area. After experimenting with band names, such as Childish Intentions and Stricken, they decided on Evanescence, which means ""disappearance"" or ""fading away"" (from the word evanesce, which means ""to disappear"").

The band released two EPs. The first is the self-titled Evanescence EP (1998), of which about 100 copies were made and distributed at the band's early live performances. The second is the Sound Asleep EP, also known as the Whisper EP (1999). There was also a third EP called Mystary EP. For their first full-length demo CD, Origin, about 2,500 copies were produced and sold to concert audiences. Origin and the EPs contain demo versions of some of the songs on their debut album, Fallen. During a radio interview, Lee and Moody encouraged fans to download the band's older songs from the Internet."
Alternative Rock,Rock/Pop,"Los Angeles, California, USA",Moody,"Red Hot Chili Peppers, also sometimes shortened to ""The Chili Peppers"" or abbreviated as ""RHCP"", are an American rock band formed in Los Angeles in 1983. The group's musical style primarily consists of rock with an emphasis on funk, as well as elements from other genres such as punk rock and psychedelic rock. When played live, their music incorporates elements of jam band due to the improvised nature of much of their performances. Currently, the band consists of founding members Anthony Kiedis (vocals), Flea (bass), longtime drummer Chad Smith; and guitarist Josh Klinghoffer, who joined in late-2009, replacing John Frusciante. Red Hot Chili Peppers have won seven Grammy Awards and have become one of the best-selling bands of all time, selling over 80 million records worldwide. In 2012, they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.
The band's original line-up featured guitarist Hillel Slovak and drummer Jack Irons, alongside Kiedis and Flea. Because of commitments to other bands, Slovak and Irons did not play on the band's self-titled debut album (1984). Cliff Martinez was the drummer for the first two records (Irons played on the third), and guitarist Jack Sherman played on the first. Slovak performed on the second and third albums by the band Freaky Styley (1985) and The Uplift Mofo Party Plan (1987), but he died from a heroin overdose in 1988. As a result of his friend's death, Irons chose to depart from the group as drummer. Parliament-Funkadelic guitarist DeWayne McKnight was brought in to replace Slovak, though his tenure was short, which forced Frusciante to replace him in 1988. Former Dead Kennedys drummer D.H. Peligro was brought in to replace Irons. His tenure was also short, so he was replaced by Chad Smith that same year. The line-up of Flea, Kiedis, Frusciante, and Smith was the longest-lasting and recorded five studio albums beginning with Mother's Milk (1989). In 1990, the group signed with Warner Bros. Records and recorded the album Blood Sugar Sex Magik (1991) under producer Rick Rubin. This album became the band's first commercial success. Frusciante grew uncomfortable with the success of the band and left abruptly in 1992, in the middle of the Blood Sugar Sex Magik Tour.
After two temporary guitarists, Dave Navarro of Jane's Addiction joined for the group's subsequent album, One Hot Minute (1995). Although commercially successful, the album failed to match the critical or popular acclaim of Blood Sugar Sex Magik, selling less than half as much as its predecessor. Navarro was fired from the band in 1998. Frusciante, fresh out of drug rehabilitation, rejoined the band that same year at Flea's request. The reunited quartet returned to the studio to record Californication (1999), which became the band's biggest commercial success with 16 million copies worldwide.

Alternative Rock,Rock/Pop,"California, USA",Angry,"Linkin Park is an American rock band from Agoura Hills, California. Formed in 1996, the band rose to international fame with their debut album, Hybrid Theory, which was certified Diamond by the RIAA in 2005 and multi-platinum in several other countries. Its following studio album, Meteora, continued the band's success, topping the Billboard 200 album chart in 2003, and was followed by extensive touring and charity work around the world. In 2003, MTV2 named Linkin Park the sixth-greatest band of the music video era and the third-best of the new millennium behind Oasis and Coldplay. Billboard ranked Linkin Park No. 19 on the Best Artists of the Decade chart.
Having adapted the nu metal and rap metal genres to a radio-friendly yet densely layered style in Hybrid Theory and Meteora, the band explored other genres in their next studio album, Minutes to Midnight, which was released in 2007. The album topped the Billboard charts and had the third-best debut week of any album that year. The band has collaborated with several other artists, most notably with rapper Jay-Z in their mashup EP Collision Course, and many others included on Reanimation. The band's most recent work, Living Things, was released on June 26, 2012. Linkin Park has sold over 50 million albums worldwide and has won two Grammy Awards.
The founding of Linkin Park began with three high school friends; Mike Shinoda, Rob Bourdon, and Brad Delson. After graduating from high school, the three began to take their musical interests more seriously, recruiting Joe Hahn, Dave ""Phoenix"" Farrell, and Mark Wakefield to perform in their band, Xero. Though limited in resources, the band began recording and producing songs within Shinoda’s makeshift bedroom studio in 1996. Tensions and frustration within the band grew after they failed to land a record deal. The lack of success and stalemate in progress prompted Wakefield, at that time the band's vocalist, to leave the band in search of other projects. Farrell also left to tour with Tasty Snax and other bands.
After spending a considerable time searching for Wakefield's replacement, Xero recruited Arizona vocalist, Chester Bennington, who was recommended by Jeff Blue, the vice president of Zomba Music in March 1999. Bennington, formerly of a post-grunge band by the name of Grey Daze, became a standout among applicants because of the dynamic in his singing style. The band then agreed on changing its name from Xero to Hybrid Theory. The newborn vocal chemistry between Shinoda and Bennington helped revive the band, inciting them to work on new material. The band’s renaissance culminated with a change in name; from Hybrid Theory, the band once again changed its name, this time to Linkin Park, a play on and homage to Santa Monica’s Lincoln Park. However, despite these changes, the band still struggled to sign a record deal. After facing numerous rejections from several major record labels, Linkin Park turned to Jeff Blue for additional help. After failing to catch Warner Bros. Records on three previous reviews, Jeff Blue, now the vice president of Warner Bros. Records, helped the band sign a deal with the company in 1999. The band released its breakthrough album, Hybrid Theory, the following year."

The origins of the band can be found in the Perth music scene. Parker played in a number of bands, one being the Dee Dee Dums, a rock duo that consisted of Parker (guitar) and Luke Epstein (drums). Tame Impala emerged as a Kevin Parker home-recording project in this period and he posted a number of tracks on Myspace.

When Carpenter was 15 years old, he was hit by a car while skateboarding. Confined to a wheelchair for several months, he began teaching himself guitar by playing along to bands such as Anthrax, Stormtroopers of Death, and Metallica. Supposedly, the driver paid Carpenter a cash settlement that allowed the band to purchase equipment, but Cunningham commented in an interview that was all just ""a myth about how our band was started."" Carpenter, Moreno, and Cunningham were friends from their childhood. All three went to McClatchy High School in Sacramento and remained friends through the city's skateboarding scene. When Moreno found out Carpenter played guitar, he set up a jam session with Cunningham, who played drums, and the three began playing regularly in Carpenter's garage circa 1988. After playing with several bassists, the band acquired Chi Cheng and recorded a four track demo soon after. Within two years, the band began playing club shows and later expanded their playing territory to San Francisco and Los Angeles, where they played shows alongside bands such as Korn.

Thrash Metal,Metal,"Los Angeles, USA",Angry,"Metallica is an American heavy metal band formed in Los Angeles, California. Metallica was formed in 1981 when vocalist/guitarist James Hetfield responded to an advertisement posted by drummer Lars Ulrich in a local newspaper. The band's current line-up comprises founding members Hetfield and Ulrich, longtime lead guitarist Kirk Hammett and bassist Robert Trujillo. Lead guitarist Dave Mustaine and bassists Ron McGovney, Cliff Burton and Jason Newsted are former members of the band. Metallica collaborated over a long period with producer Bob Rock, who produced all of the band's albums from 1990 to 2003 and served as a temporary bassist between the departure of Newsted and the hiring of Trujillo.
The band's fast tempos, instrumentals, and aggressive musicianship placed them as one of the founding ""big four"" bands of thrash metal, alongside Anthrax, Megadeth, and Slayer. The band earned a growing fan base in the underground music community and won critical acclaim with its first four albums; their third album Master of Puppets (1986) was described as one of the most influential and heaviest of thrash metal albums. Metallica achieved substantial commercial success with its eponymous fifth album Metallica (1991), which debuted at number one on the Billboard 200. With this release the band expanded its musical direction, resulting in an album that appealed to a more mainstream audience. In 2000, Metallica was among a number of artists who filed a lawsuit against Napster for sharing the band's copyright-protected material for free without consent from any band member. A settlement was reached and Napster became a pay-to-use service. Despite reaching number one on the Billboard 200, the release of St. Anger (2003) alienated many fans with the exclusion of guitar solos and the ""steel-sounding"" snare drum. A film titled Some Kind of Monster documented the recording of St. Anger and the tensions within the band during that time. In 2009, Metallica was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.
Metallica has released nine studio albums, four live albums, five extended plays, 26 music videos, and 37 singles. The band has won eight Grammy Awards and five of its albums have consecutively debuted at number one on the Billboard 200. The band's eponymous 1991 album has sold over 16 million copies in the United States, making it the best-selling album of the SoundScan era. Metallica ranks as one of the most commercially successful bands of all time, having sold over 110 million records worldwide. Metallica has been listed as one of the greatest artists of all time by many magazines, including Rolling Stone, which ranked them 61st on its list of The 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. As of December 2012, Metallica is the third best-selling music artist since Nielsen SoundScan began tracking sales in 1991, selling a total of 54.26 million albums in the U.S. In 2012, Metallica formed the independent record label Blackened Recordings and took full ownership of its albums and videos. As of 2016, the band is in production of its tenth studio album, which is expected to be released later in the year."
Hip-Hop,,Florida,,"Jahseh Dwayne Ricardo Onfroy (January 23, 1998 – June 18, 2018), known professionally as XXXTentacion was an American rapper and singer-songwriter. Though a controversial figure due to his widely publicized legal troubles, XXXTentacion gained a cult following among his young fanbase during his short career with his depression- and alienation-themed music. Critics and fans often credit him for his musical versatility, with his music exploring emo, trap, trap metal, nu metal, indie rock, lo-fi, hip hop, R&B, and punk rock. He is considered to be a leading figure in the emo rap and SoundCloud rap genres, which garnered mainstream attention during the mid-to-late 2010s.

Born in Plantation, Florida, XXXTentacion spent most of his childhood in Lauderhill. He began writing music after being released from a juvenile detention center and soon started his music career on SoundCloud in 2013, employing styles and techniques that were unconventional in rap music such as distortion and heavy guitar-backed instrumentals, drawing inspiration from third-wave emo and grunge. In 2014, he formed the underground collective Members Only and alongside other members of the collective soon became a popular figure in SoundCloud rap, a trap music scene that takes elements of lo-fi music and harsh 808s. XXXTentacion gained mainstream attention with the single ""Look at Me"". His debut album 17 (2017) is certified triple-platinum in the US and reached number two on the Billboard 200. His second album ? (2018) debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and is certified quintuple-platinum in the US.

XXXTentacion had faced a variety of legal issues throughout his lifetime, most notably the controversy that arose from the battery charges that were levied against him in 2016. XXXTentacion's history of legal issues and alleged violence has been described by some as defining his legacy, while others have criticized the media's portrayal of him, arguing that his perceived improvements in character later in life have made his legacy into a tale of the power of second chances and redemption.

On June 18, 2018, XXXTentacion, age 20, was murdered when he was shot near a motorcycle dealership in Deerfield Beach, Florida. The attackers fled the scene in an SUV after stealing his Louis Vuitton bag containing $50,000 in cash. Four suspects were arrested and charged with first-degree murder among other charges. In August 2022, one of the four men pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in exchange for testimony against the other three defendants in their trial. The trial initiated on February 7, 2023. On March 20, 2023, all three were found guilty on all counts. On April 6, 2023, they were sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.

XXXTentacion has RIAA-certified sales of 61 million units in the US and BPI-certified sales of over 7 million units in the UK, bringing his total to 68 million certified records sold in the two countries. Since his death, he has won an American Music Award and a BET Hip Hop Award and received 11 Billboard Music Award nominations. Two posthumous albums were released, Skins (2018) and Bad Vibes Forever (2019); the former became his second number-one album on the Billboard 200, while the latter entered the top 5."

Hip-Hop,Electronic,"Tupelo, Mississippi, USA",Energetic,"Wes Pentz aka Diplo was born in Tupelo, Mississippi. Most of his childhood was spent in Florida, where his father still owns and runs a bait shop. His youth was spent discussing 'gators with his uncle, working in pop's store and dreaming of dinosaurs living hidden out in the swamp. As he grew up he began to channel these obsessions into music (Miami Bass being a touchstone, of course) and film.

After a brief stint at film school and a season out on the shrimp boats, the need to escape from America for a while led to some time in Japan, from where he sent the beat doodles he had been working on to Big Dada in the UK and was promptly signed. He returned to the US and moved to Philly where he and another DJ, Low Budget, began their now-legendary Hollertronix sessions. The Hollertronix mix cd, 'Never Scared' followed and later in the year the lost classic 'Epistemology Suite' EP became his first release for Big Dada.

'Florida' followed soon after, the debut album which he described as ""based loosely on Wiliam Faulkner's 'Go Down Moses' with a definite red clay shrimp and manatee dirty south feel."" Featuring vocals from Martina Topley-Bird, Vybz Cartel, PEACE, Pantera Os Danadinhos and Sandra Melody, it showed the breadth of Diplo's imagination and the depth of his influences. It was welcomed ecstatically by those who found it but is still to reach the audience it deserved. 

Since the record was released, Diplo has become a major star. Starting with the critically-acclaimed and hard-to-find mix cds 'Favela On Blast', 'AEIOU' Vols 1 & 2, M.I.A.'s 'Piracy Funds Terrorism' and 'Hollertronix 2', Pentz built up a reputation as a go-to producer which culminated in his Grammy nomination for MIA's ""Paper Planes."" Alongside Switch he also started the Major Lazer project and produced for artists including Beyonce, No Doubt, Usher and Justin Bieber. In 2009, Big Dada released ""Decent Work For Decent Pay,"" a compilation of Diplo's productions and remixes."

He first broke through as the front figure of the controversial collective Odd Future, and has since established himself as one of the most innovative voices in modern hip-hop.

She was born in Saint James, Trinidad and Tobago and when she was 5 years of age she moved to the New York City borough of Queens, where she grew up.
After releasing three mixtapes between 2007 and 2009 and being signed to Young Money Entertainment in August 2009, Minaj released her debut album, Pink Friday, in November 2010. It quickly became a commercial success, peaking at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200 and being certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) a month after its release. She became the first female solo artist to have seven singles on the Billboard Hot 100 at the same time. Her second single, ""Your Love"", reached number 1 on the Billboard Hot Rap Songs chart, making Minaj the first female artist to top the chart unaccompanied since 2002. She also became the first female artist to be included on MTV's Annual Hottest MC List. Minaj was named the 2011 Rising Star by Billboard. Her second studio album, Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded was released on April 3, 2012.
Maraj was born in 1982 in Saint James, a suburb of Trinidad and Tobago's capital city Port of Spain. Her parents are of mixed Indian and Afro-Trinidadian ancestry and she lived in Saint James with her grandmother until age five, because her parents were looking for a place to live in the Queens borough of New York City at the time. Her mother would occasionally visit, and one day, when Minaj was five, her mother picked her up to move to Queens. According to Minaj, her father drank heavily, took drugs, and once tried to kill her mother by setting the house on fire.
She attended Elizabeth Blackwell Middle School 210, where she played the clarinet. She graduated from LaGuardia High School. At LaGuardia, a school specializing in music and the visual and performing arts, Minaj participated in the drama program. She had initially planned to sing at LaGuardia but lost her voice on the day of the audition."
,,,,"Snapper is a New Zealand indie/alternative band formed by Peter Gutteridge (previously in The Clean, The Chills and The Great Unwashed). Snapper's activity since the late 1990s has been sporadic at best. The Gutteridge-penned song ""Gentle Hour"" was covered by Yo La Tengo in 2009.

The band evolved from the line-up of another Gutteridge-led band, the Dunedin-based Phromes. A show supporting the Delawares featuring Christine Voice drew her melodic organ and haunting vocals to the fold and with input from Alan Haig on drums and Dominic Stones (who went on to the 3Ds) on guitar, the line-up was complete.

Snapper's first full-length album, Shotgun Blossom, was released in 1992 with the original line-up. The seven inch single ""Vadar"" b/w ""Gentle Hour"", was released in 1993 as the band began to fragment somewhat. 

The full-length album, A.D.M., was released in 1996 and is predominantly Gutteridge singing and playing all instruments with Mike Dooley on drums. Christine Voice, together with Demarnia Lloyd (from Cloudboy) and Celia Pavlova (from King Loser) feature as guest vocalists.

Although never completely defunct; Snapper's activity since the late 1990s has been sporadic at best. In 2000 the Gutteridge, Voice and Dooley line-up, with additional members Maxine Funke and Thomas Bell, came together to perform a show as part of Dunedin City's Festival of the Arts.

Snapper re-formed for a concert in Dunedin in July 2012, and toured the NZ North Island in February 2013.

The Gutteridge-penned song ""Gentle Hour"" was covered by Yo La Tengo on the 2009 collaborative album ""Dark Was The Night"".   . "

Artistry
Influences
In Billboard's ""You Should Know"" series, Cardi B said the first albums she ever purchased were by American entertainers Missy Elliott and Tweet, respectively. She also cited American pop singers Madonna and Lady Gaga as two of her favorite artists. She has credited Puerto Rican rapper Ivy Queen and Jamaican dancehall artist Spice as influences as well.

In an interview with music website Hollywood Unlocked, when asked about the initial direction for her music, Cardi B said, ""When I first started rapping  I liked certain songs from Khia and Trina, and they  fighting songs. I haven't heard fighting songs for a very long time,"" crediting the two female rappers for her aggressive rap style. She continued saying ""a lot of girls they can not afford red bottoms, a lot of girls they can not afford foreign cars  but I know that every girl has beef with a girl  I know that every bitch don't like some bitch, and it's like 'that's what I wanna rap about.'""

Musical style
AllMusic editor David Jeffries called Cardi B ""a raw and aggressive rapper in the style of Lil' Kim and Foxy Brown."" Stereogum called her voice ""a full-bodied New Yawk nasal bleat, the sort of thing that you've heard if someone has ever told you that you stupid for taking too long at swiping your MetroCard."" They continued to call her voice ""an unabashedly loud and sexual fuck-you New York honk—that translates perfectly to rap."" In a 2017 Complex article about her, the editor wrote ""unapologetic does not begin to describe the totally unfiltered and sheer Cardi B-ness of Cardi B's personality. She's a hood chick who's not afraid to be hood no matter the setting. Cardi B is Cardi B 24/7, 365, this is why she resonates with people, and that same energy comes out in her music.""

Other ventures
Fashion
As Cardi B rose to prominence she was able to transition from a stripper to modeling for fashion websites In February 2017, she partnered with M.A.C and Rio Uribe's Gypsy Sport for an event for New York Fashion Week. During an April 2017 interview with HotNewHipHop, Cardi B spoke on being rejected by fashion designers. Her April appearance in i-D's ""A-Z of Music"" video was sponsored by designer Marc Jacobs, and she made the cover of The Fader's July/August 2017 Summer Music issue.

In August 2017, the Style section of the New York Times's Sunday edition did a half-page story on her. The writer reported on her preparations for her first public performance in New York City, at MoMA PS1, describing her appearance as she arrived to the interview in ""leggings, an Atlanta Braves 'Lost Bravos' logo jersey and white Yeezy sneakers"". She also covered Cardi's affinity for Christian Louboutin heels (a running theme in her song ""Bodak Yellow""), and the custom local designer, LaQuan Smith, whose red dress she wore to perform.

Public image
Cardi B identifies as a feminist. The New York Times wrote ""on Love & Hip Hop: New York some viewers saw her as a hero of female empowerment, as she made pronouncements like

'Ever since I started using guys, I feel so much better about myself. I feel so damn powerful.'""

When commenting on her rise to stardom The Fader wrote ""one video in particular tipped her popularity over the edge. It was a 13-second clip that doubles as a neat précis of her ethos:

'People be asking me, 'What do you does? Are you a model? Are you, like, a comedian or something?' Nah, I ain't none of that. I'm a hoe. I'm a stripper hoe. I'm about this shmoney.'""

Personal life
Religion
Cardi B is of Christian faith, believing in God and Jesus Christ; she has mentioned her ""strong relationship"" with God in interviews, often saying that she ""talks to Him"": ""If you know me, you know that I have this deep connection to God. Is it crazy for me to say that I used to ask God to please help me? The strip club really helped me. I can say that it saved me…God put that in my way.""

Relationships
As of early 2017, Cardi B began publicly dating fellow American rapper Offset, of the southern hip hop group Migos, and the two quickly became a prevalent couple in the music industry. When speaking on her relationship with Offset, Cardi B told The Fader, ""It’s been a blessing, me meeting him and meeting his friends. I see how hard they work. And that motivated me to work even harder. And I see how good things are going for them and how popping it is to be number one. And I’m like, I want that. A lot of people just see they jewelry and they money, but I don’t think a lot of people see how hard they work for that shit every single day."" Cardi B and Offset became engaged on October 27, after Offset proposed to Cardi B at the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia, during the Power 99 Powerhouse concert. According to a report from TMZ, shortly after Offset and Cardi B became engaged, a handful of TV networks, including BET, VH1 and WE tv, began making offers for a nationally televised wedding special.

Band's line up:
Nick Douglas - Vocals

Blake Peel - Bass
Jeremy McDonald - Drums

3. Vera—a Florida based rock band—has continually captivated audiences with their vibrant tones and rich, dynamic melodies. Vera has opened up for well-known acts such as Orlando’s Between The Trees, Rookie Of The Year, and national rising act–Fireflight. 

""From the pulsing bass line at the start of “Sound” to the vibrant guitars at the end of “Warm Me Up,” The Sound is a compelling EP that reflects melody, unity and honesty. Hinting influences that range from Coldplay to MuteMath to Pink Floyd, this album manages to create an atmospheric soundscape that elevates and alleviates the listener from the mundane tones music listeners so often face today.”

As Vera—whose lineup includes frontman and lead singer/songwriter - William David, guitarist Patrick Chin, piano/keyboardist Erich Von Hinken, drummer Jordan Colle, and bassist Rob Polischuck—engages in the process of writing songs for the band’s follow up recording and begins performing live in Tallahassee, David’s hometown of Orlando and other venues throughout the state, it’s fascinating to realize that a year ago, the notion of a budding career fronting a rock band and a debut project in the marketplace was the furthest thing from David’s mind.

“The chemistry with the guys in Vera is very powerful,” he adds, “and we’re working on tons of new material that’s less Coldplayish pop and more edgy and rocking, yet still very melodic. Melodies have always been my strength, a direct result of my love for The Beatles and appreciation for the simple relationship between melody, chord progression and lyrics. I’m a huge fan of simplicity both in my life and music, so no matter how deep and abstract I get in my songwriting, there’s always the core of accessible melodies and lyrics.”

From her upbringing	
in the German town of Heidelberg to her first international residency at ‘Monza Club Ibiza’ in 2005, Vera has steadily developed into the league of Frankfurt’s most prominent exports for club music. She stands for deep, electronic music that meanders between the traditional banks of house and techno. Juggling the dual role of DJ and producer effortlessly, the past few years have seen her release an exclusive mix for Monza Ibiza as well as sophisticated productions in collaboration with Miss Fitz as the duo ‘Mara Trax’. With a debut solo EP imminent and bookings at a number of Europe’s top clubs, the past years have been exceptionally fruitful for Vera. 

Musical exploration	
During her childhood she was mostly surrounded by classical music and got her basic musical education by studying some instruments. At the age of 14 she started to listen to hip hop and house music and was intrigued. When she finally entered a techno club in Frankfurt in 1993, she found exactly what she had been looking for.

Vera started collecting mix-tapes and listened to uncountable DJ-Sets. She developed her preferences for Chicago house, music from Detroit and the sound of Maurizio, Studio1, Thomas Brinkmann and the early Perlon and Playhouse releases.

After spending 7 years on the dancefloors, Vera started buying records. Roman Flügel from Alter Ego was one of the first, who invited her to play at Robert Johnson in 2003 and she became Resident DJ at one of Europes most respected and authentic clubs. 

In 2005 Vera got her first international residency, on the weekly „Monza Club Ibiza"". In 2006 she played at Space and DC 10 and after releasing her exclusive compilation mix CD for Monza Ibiza she found herself in places all over Europe (and further). In the past years she graced numerous top clubs with her presence, such as Panoramabar (Berlin), Warehouse (Tokyo), Rex (Paris), Fabric (London), Goa (Rome) and my more.

Music Production	
Vera stands for sophisticated, deep, electronic dance music, somewhere between house and techno. She has started to work on her own definition of house music – bridging classic house with new influences. Her first track „In the nook"" was released on Spanish minimal label Cyclical Tracks in December 2007. As Mara Trax, a collaboration with Miss Fitz aka Maayan Nidam, Vera produced two EPs in 2008, one on Cyclical Tracks and another one on Oslo Records Together with Federico Molinari she also released an EP on „Love letters from oslo“. But finally in July 2008 Vera has released her first solo EP on Cargo Edition.

Trip Hop,Electronic,"Gothenburg, Sweden",,"Karin Elisabeth Dreijer Andersson (born 7 April 1975 in Nacka, Sweden), also known by her stage name Fever Ray, is the lead vocalist of the electronic duo The Knife, formed with her brother Olof Dreijer. Andersson was previously the vocalist and guitarist of the alternative rock band Honey Is Cool. Andersson released her debut solo album under the name Fever Ray in 2009. Her vocal style is notable for both shrill and deep tones, and also the use of multitracked vocals, with different uses of pitch-shifting technology on each track, creating an intricate, mysterious effect. Many listeners mistake the deep vocals on songs by The Knife for those of her brother. Visually, Dreijer Andersson employs the use of masks, face and body paint, intricate costumes, and other theatrical elements in photo shoots, videos and live performances, during which she often performs behind a gauze screen that partially obscures her from view."
Pop,Rock/Pop,"London, England, UK",Happy,"Lily Rose Beatrice Cooper (née Allen; born 2 May 1985), known professionally as Lily Allen, is an English singer, songwriter, actress, and television presenter. She is the daughter of Keith Allen and film producer Alison Owen. Allen left school when she was 15 and concentrated on improving her performing and compositional skills. In 2005, she made some of her recordings public on Myspace and the publicity resulted in airplay on BBC Radio 1 and a contract with Regal Recordings.
Her first mainstream single, ""Smile"", reached number one on the UK Singles Chart in July 2006. Her debut record, Alright, Still, was well received, selling over 2.6 million copies worldwide and brought Allen a nomination at the Grammy Awards, Brit Awards and MTV Video Music Awards. She began hosting her own talk-show, Lily Allen and Friends, on BBC Three.
Her second studio album, It's Not Me, It's You, saw a genre shift, having more of an electropop feel, rather than the ska and reggae influences of the first one. The album debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart and the Australian ARIA Charts and was well received by critics, noting the singer's musical evolution and maturity. It spawned the hit singles ""The Fear"" and ""Fuck You"". This success saw her receive the Brit Award for British Female Solo Artist at the 2010 Brit Awards. Allen and Amy Winehouse were credited with starting a process that led to the ""year of the women"" media label in 2009 that saw five female artists making music of ""experimentalism and fearlessness"" nominated for the Mercury Prize.
In 2009, Allen announced that she would be taking a hiatus from musical activities. In 2011, she launched her own record label. In 2013, Allen revealed that she had begun working on her third studio album, which was later titled Sheezus. On 12 November 2013, Allen premiered the video for her first original song since 2009, ""Hard out Here"", which was released as a single five days later."

Alternative Rock,,,,"Blueline Medic are a four piece rock band from Melbourne, Australia.

The group formed in mid-1999 after the downfall of bands Caustic Soda and Mid Youth Crisis from which guitarists Donnie Dureau and Adrian Lombardi were members. In forming the initial lineup they were joined on bass by Dave Snow, formerly of The Bradshaw Figure, and Lachlan Hodgson, who drummed for Caustic Soda, and recorded their first EP, A Working Title In Green, released on Sony.

Shortly after the release, Hodgson left the band and they were dropped by Sony. Shaun Lohoar (who has also played in a number of Melbourne-based bands, most notably Pollyanna) was recruited as the new drummer.

After being signed by Fueled by Ramen (who then licensed their albums to Redline Records for release in Australia), the band released their debut album, The Apology Wars in 2001. The album included the lead single ""Making the Nouveau Riche"" which was voted into the No. 68 position in the Triple J Hottest 100, 2001. Subsequent releases have included a 12 track compilation with Midtown, The Movielife and Secondbest, their second album Text Bomb in 2003 and a 6-track split EP in 2005 with Ted Leo and the Pharmacists (who subsequently supported Blueline Medic on an Australian tour) on Casadeldisco Records. 2007 saw the release of their third album 42:19.

In 2008, Blueline Medic joined Melbourne label Hobbledehoy Record Co. and released The Middle Of The End 7"", whom later released 42:19 on vinyl and the CD format (outside of Australia).

Lineup changes ensued both before and after the release of the The Photo Album (2001), and the group's album Transatlanticism (2003) gained the band commercial success.

Gallows released their debut album, Orchestra of Wolves, in 2006. It was distributed in the United States by independent label Epitaph in 2007. Epitaph founder and Bad Religion guitarist Brett Gurewitz called it the best hardcore album since Refused’s The Shape of Punk to Come. In January 2008, the band’s show at the House of Blues in Anaheim, California was canceled after Disney chose to ban them from performing—reportedly after listening to Orchestra of Wolves.

A second album by Gallows was first hinted by ex-vocalist Frank Carter during an interview with NME, where he stated that because Gallows was “a hobby I get paid for,” the band would likely be defunct by 2010. However, he confirmed that during this period, the band would record up to two additional albums.

Gallows released their major label debut, Grey Britain, on May 2, 2009. It was recorded by Garth Richardson. It debuted at #20 in the UK album chart. Frank Carter explained the premise of the album in an interview with Kerrang!: “Britain is fucked. Grey Britain is all about what’s going on socially, politically and economically in the UK and how it affects us.”

Upon its release, Grey Britain garnered almost unanimous praise from critics. Drowned in Sound commented that “the music rockets from intentionally rudimentary knuckle-whiteners to ambitious-of-design affairs that reconfigure one’s opinions on a band previously seen as a straight-up hardcore act.” The Guardian called the album “a recipe for depression, frustration and anger, as a whole generation has been brought up in a materialistic, consumerist world that has now receded out of reach.”

On the 8th July 2011, Frank Carter had confirmed he had left Gallows.

“It is with a heavy heart that I have to announce my departure from Gallows. It seems that Gallows have hit a crossroads in our writing process and unfortunately myself and the rest of the boys have different ideas regarding the sound of Gallows going forward. Gallows have decided they are going to continue on without me and I wish the boys the best of luck for the future. Gallows will be fulfilling all of our current touring plans until August 1st so please come down to a show and help me make each show a total celebration!”

Frank is now in Pure Love, a band which consists of himself and Jim Carroll (Suicide File, Hope Conspiracy)

Gallows have replaced Frank with ex-Alexisonfire guitarist/vocalist Wade MacNeil, and are set to release an EP called Death Is Birth in December 2011."

Formed in 2002 in High Green, a suburb of Sheffield, the band currently consists of Alex Turner (lead vocals, lead/rhythm guitar), Jamie Cook (rhythm/lead guitar), Nick O'Malley (bass guitar, backing vocals) and Matt Helders (drums, backing vocals). Former members include Andy Nicholson (bass guitar, backing vocals) and Glyn Jones (lead vocals, rhythm guitar).

The band have released four studio albums: Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not (2006), Favourite Worst Nightmare (2007), Humbug (2009) and Suck It and See (2011), as well as one live album At the Apollo (2008). The band's debut album became the fastest-selling debut album in British music history, surpassing Oasis' Definitely Maybe and remains the fastest-selling debut album for a band in the UK.
Arctic Monkeys were heralded as one of the first group of acts to come to the public attention via the Internet (fan-based sites rather than from the band), with commentators suggesting they represented the possibility of a change in the way in which new bands are promoted and marketed. The band are also regarded as one of the most prominent bands to be part of the post-punk revival in the UK, after achieving commercial success and spawning two number one singles with their debut album.

The band began rehearsing at Yellow Arch Studios in Neepsend, and played their first gig on 13 June 2003 at The Grapes in Sheffield city-centre. After a few performances in 2003, the band began to record demos at 2fly studios in Sheffield. 17 songs were demoed in all and the collection, now known as Beneath the Boardwalk, was burned on to CDs to give away at gigs, which were promptly file-shared amongst fans. The name Beneath the Boardwalk originated when the first batch of demos were sent around. The first sender, wanting to classify the demos, named them after where he received them, the Boardwalk. Slowly, as more demos were spread, they were all classified under this name. This has led to many people falsely believing that Beneath the Boardwalk was an early album, or that the early demos were all released under this heading. The group did not mind the distribution, saying ""we never made those demos to make money or anything. We were giving them away free anyway - that was a better way for people to hear them."", admitting that they did not even know how to get their songs onto the Internet. When asked about the popularity of the band's MySpace site in an interview with Prefix Magazine, the band said that they were unaware what it was, and that the site had originally been created by their fans.
The band began to grow in popularity across the north of England, receiving attention from BBC Radio and the British tabloid press. A local amateur photographer, Mark Bull, filmed the band's performances and made the music video ""Fake Tales of San Francisco"", releasing it on his website, alongside the contents of Beneath the Boardwalk - a collection of the band's songs which he named after a local music venue. In May 2005, Arctic Monkeys released their first single, Five Minutes with Arctic Monkeys on their own 'Bang Bang' label, featuring the songs ""Fake Tales of San Francisco"" and ""From the Ritz to the Rubble"". This release was limited to 500 CDs and 1,000 7"" records, but was also available to download from the iTunes Music Store. Soon after, the band played at the Carling Stage of the Reading and Leeds Festivals, reserved for less known or unsigned bands. Their appearance was hyped by much of the music press and the band was watched by an unusually large crowd."

Grunge,Rock/Pop,"Seattle, Washington, USA",Gritty,"Soundgarden was an American rock band formed in Seattle, Washington, in 1984 by singer and drummer Chris Cornell, lead guitarist Kim Thayil (both of whom are the only members to appear in every incarnation of the band), and bassist Hiro Yamamoto; Cornell switched to rhythm guitar in 1985, replaced on drums initially by Scott Sundquist, and later by Matt Cameron in 1986. Yamamoto left in 1990 and was replaced initially by Jason Everman and shortly thereafter by Ben Shepherd. The band dissolved in 1997 and re-formed in 2010. Following Cornell's death in 2017 and a year of uncertainty regarding the band's future, Thayil declared in October 2018 that Soundgarden had disbanded once again, though they did reunite in January 2019 for a one-off concert in tribute to Cornell.

The band helped to popularize grunge music, a style of alternative rock that developed in the American Pacific Northwest in the mid-1980s, alongside such Seattle contemporaries as Alice in Chains, Pearl Jam, and Nirvana. They were the first of a number of grunge bands to sign to the Seattle-based record label Sub Pop, through which they released EPs in both 1987 and 1988. California-based independent label SST Records released Soundgarden's debut album, Ultramega OK, which, although it did not sell well nationally, garnered critical acclaim and was nominated for a Grammy award in 1990. Their second album, Louder Than Love, was recorded independently, but, after they signed with A&M Records in 1989 (making them one of the first grunge bands to sign to a major label), the album became their major-label debut. While Ultramega OK had failed to chart and Louder Than Love peaked at number 108 on the Billboard 200 album chart, the band's third album, Badmotorfinger, buoyed by the success of the singles ""Jesus Christ Pose"", ""Outshined"", and ""Rusty Cage"", reached number 39 on the Billboard 200 and has been certified double-platinum by the RIAA.

Soundgarden achieved its biggest success with the 1994 album Superunknown, which debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and yielded the Grammy Award-winning singles ""Spoonman"" and ""Black Hole Sun"". The band experimented with new sonic textures on their follow-up album Down on the Upside, which debuted at number 2 on the Billboard 200 in 1996 and spawned several hit singles of its own, including ""Burden in My Hand"" and ""Blow Up the Outside World"". In 1997, the band broke up due to internal strife over its creative direction and exhaustion from touring. After more than a decade of working on projects and other bands, they reunited in 2010, and Republic Records released their sixth and final studio album, King Animal, two years later.

As of 2019, Soundgarden had sold more than 14 million records in the United States, and an estimated 30 million worldwide. VH1 ranked Soundgarden at number 14 in their special 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock."

They consisted of rap songs, swearing, rants, extreme challenges, ukulele performances and a shock humor show titled The Filthy Frank Show, with most of the main characters played by Miller, including the titular character of Filthy Frank. To complement his TVFilthyFrank channel, Miller produced comedy hip hop music under his Pink Guy alias, who is also a zentai-wearing recurring character on The Filthy Frank Show, with his songs featured on the show and his discography spanning two full-length projects and an extended play. Miller's videos had widespread impact, including starting a viral dance craze known as the Harlem Shake, which was directly responsible for the debut of Baauer's ""Harlem Shake"" song atop the Billboard Hot 100. Many YouTube personalities have made major or cameo appearances on The Filthy Frank Show, including h3h3Productions, iDubbbz, JonTron, Michael Stevens, and PewDiePie.

In December 2017, Miller stated he had retired the channel to focus on his music career, under the name Joji, producing more nuanced and serious music, releasing the EP In Tongues, which peaked at number 58 on the Billboard 200, and his debut studio album Ballads 1, which reached number 1 on Billboard's top R&B and hip-hop chart in November 2018. With this, Miller became the first Asian-born artist to do so. Miller's music has been described as a mix between R&B, lo-fi and trip hop."

Country,Country,"Sneedville, Tennessee, USA",,"Morgan Wallen (born May 13, 1993 in Sneedville, Tennessee) is an American country music artist. He signed with Big Loud Records and released an extended play and a single, ""The Way I Talk."" His father was a preacher, and as a child, Wallen took piano and violin lessons. He played baseball in college, but chose to look for music instead after an injury. In 2014, he competed in season 6 of The Voice, but was eliminated.
At the end of 2016, Wallen signed with Big Loud Records, a label owned by record producer Joey Moi. He released his debut single ""The Way I Talk"" shortly after. In addition, he co-wrote the single ""Preachin 'to the Choir of A Thousand Horses."" In April 2017, Wallen released a music video for ""The Way I Talk"". She also joined the Florida Georgia Line to set dates on her Dig Your Roots Tour. He’s a passionate singer with a unique sound who grew up in Appalachia, and you’ll be hearing Morgan Wallen before 2016 is over. Wallen moved to Nashville in July 2015, not sure what he would find, but convinced that he should at least give his dreams a legitimate shot. Less than a year later, he’d already been signed to Big Loud Records, recorded some initial tracks with producer Joey Moi (Florida Georgia Line, Jake Owen) and hit the road on his first radio promotion tour.
It might appear that Wallen’s on the fast track, but it took him a while to get there. Born in Sneedville, Tennessee (a town that also lays claim as the birthplace of bluegrass pioneer Jimmy Martin), to a hard-rock-lovin’ preacher and contemporary-Christian-devoted teacher, Wallen showed his musical interests early, singing in front of the local congregation at age three and asking for a violin for his fifth birthday. He would soon switch to piano and later add guitar to his arsenal, though he never really imagined it was possible to make a career of it.
“I didn’t think that was realistic because I had no clue about how the music business worked,” Wallen says. “Even living three hours away, I had no idea about Nashville.”
Instead, he focused his efforts on baseball, and he was pretty good at it. Playing shortstop and pitcher for Gibbs High School in Corryton, the same school where Kenny Chesney graduated. Wallen earned an offer to continue playing at a major college.
But fate intervened. While pitching during his senior year, he felt a pop in his right elbow and would undergo a tendon replacement procedure. While he was able to continue playing guitar and piano, it proved to be the end of his baseball career.
“Looking back, I’m glad it happened the way it did, because I really actually loved music more than I ever did baseball,” he says.
The kind of music almost didn’t matter. Rock, hip-hop, country – he loved it all, particularly the emotional connection that it created between the musician and the listener. But when he wrote, the music was invariably country.
“Writing music was a way for me to get my feelings out,” he says. “I don’t really express my feelings very much, and I guess it was just a way for me to let some of that go. It’s my safe place.”
His mother signed him up to audition for NBC’s The Voice, convinced that he’d do well. Wallen had no idea what to expect – he’d never seen the show – but he was chosen by Usher and was later stolen by Adam Levine. The last song he performed during his run, a cover of Florida Georgia Line’s “Stay,” helped him steer him toward his creative destiny.
“Honestly, I was just trying to figure out who I was,” he reflects. “I was trying to figure out me as a person, me as an artist. It was one way to do it.”
During his time in California, Wallen met Sergio Sanchez, the lead singer and writer for Jive Records’ hard-rock band Atom Smash. While Sanchez initially served as Wallen’s vocal coach, they hit it off and started co-writing regularly in Knoxville. Armed with new music, Wallen and Sanchez moved to Nashville and became ingrained in the city’s music community. From there, things moved quickly. Wallen’s managers, Dirk Hemsath and Mike Bachta of Working Group Artist Management, set him up to play for William Morris Endeavor’s Kevin Neal, agent for Jason Aldean and Florida Georgia Line. Neal signed him on the spot. Hemsath and Bachta next sent demos to Big Loud Shirt’s Seth England, hoping to land some co-writing opportunities with songwriters at the publishing company. England was so impressed that he brought Morgan in to audition for his partners in Big Loud Records: Craig Wiseman, Clay Hunnicutt, Kevin “Chief” Zaruk and Joey Moi. They signed Wallen to both the label and the publishing company.
Wallen started woodshedding as a songwriter, working with the likes of Wiseman (“Live Like You Were Dying”), Rodney Clawson (“Dirt”), Chris Tompkins (“Drunk On A Plane”), the Warren Brothers (“Highway Don’t Care”), Tommy Cecil (“Home Alone Tonight”) and Matt Dragstrem (“Sippin’ On Fire”). Meanwhile, Big Loud proved that it was big-league – while Wallen worked on his own music, the label’s first-ever single, Chris Lane’s “Fix,” went into the Top 15 and continued climbing, an unheard-of start for a brand-new label.
Wallen hopes to build a similar story. He headed out on a promotion tour of radio stations in the summer of 2016, giving him a chance to start playing for people again after spending so much of the previous year in writing rooms and the recording studio. The end goal is to be on a stage, making that emotional connection with his distinctive sound. But it takes time to get there.
“We’ve just really been trying to get the focus on the music,” he says. “If we don’t have that, then there’s no point in playing.”"

,,,,"If Riley Green isn’t strumming a six-string and singing, chances are you’ll find him dropping a line in the Ohatchee River, deep sea fishing in Orange Beach, AL, turkey hunting at his primitive camp in Arkansas, or deer hunting at his ‘Back 40 Bash’ property. For this 6’4, blue-eyed, country crooner from Jacksonville, AL it’s not just a “Country State of Mind” - it’s a lifestyle. 

Riley has achieved an incredible amount of success for someone doing it all on their own. Though you wouldn’t know it by talking to him, Green is as humble as they come for someone who has released three popular EP’s, stars in two TV shows (Winner of Redneck Island on CMT and his very own hunting show on DirtRoadTV), thousands of social media fans/followers, and has played across the southeast for the last 5 years to hordes of music lovers singing the words of his Alabama anthem (“Bury Me In Dixie”) back to him. People don’t even realize Riley’s an accomplished musician when meeting him. He’s not inclined to brag or talk about himself. 

Riley was born into songwriting and performing; spending days and nights with his grandfather, Bufford Green. “My PawPaw opened a music hall in 2003, where he’d always say music goes from ‘The Bar Room to The Pulpit and Back’ each Friday Night. My Granddaddy Buford taught me a love for the sound of old traditional country, bluegrass, and southern gospel music,” explains Riley. The youngster performed at the Golden Saw Music Hall, singing songs like “Wreck on the Highway” and “Precious Jewel” by Roy Acuff with his grandfather and other men of his generation. “My Best Friend” was written as a tribute to his Granddaddy Bufford and the influence he had on Riley’s life & music. “Line in the Water” was inspired by fishing trips with his other grandfather, Granddaddy Lendon, who left a mark on the southern boy by showing him how to truly relax and enjoy the southern lifestyle.

Outside of music, Riley always found time for athletics. Riley, a three sport athlete in high school and a walk-on quarterback at Jacksonville State University understands the importance that comes from playing sports and being part of a team. 

Many of Riley’s next generation of songs reflect on the experiences of a young southern man trying to find his place in the world. With a mixture of outlaw-rebellion and respect for tradition, Riley combined these values to create his own style. “’A Little Hank’ and ‘Almost’ reflect the battle of values and what my grandfather referred to as ‘the fine line between Saturday night and Sunday morning,’” he explains. Green’s latest EP titled “County Line” which was released earlier this year and reached #14 on the iTunes Country Chart. He has also been recognized by BuzzFeed and Whiskey Riff as an up-and-comer to keep an eye on.

At the end of the day, Riley Green is still that Alabama boy grounded in the values instilled by generations of southern gentlemen. The outdoors man (who is more than likely to address you by Sir or Mam) remains true to himself whether he’s headlining his annual homecoming show (Back 40 Bash) in front of thousands of fans or tending his deer plots as his golden Labrador (Sadie) follows close behind. This is only the beginning for the next country music star from Dixie! For more information on Riley Green visit www.rileygreenmusic.com . "

Country,Country,"Maces Spring, Virginia, USA",,"The Carter Family was a traditional American folk music group that recorded between 1927 and 1956. Their music had a profound impact on bluegrass, country, Southern Gospel, pop and rock musicians as well as on the U.S. folk revival of the 1960s. They were the first vocal group to become country music stars. Their recordings of songs as “Wabash Cannonball”, “Can the Circle Be Unbroken”, “Wildwood Flower”, “Keep On the Sunny Side” and their most well-known “I'm Thinking Tonight of My Blue Eyes” made them country standards, especially the latter which had significant re-exposure as Roy Acuff's “The Great Speckled Bird”, Kitty Wells' “It Wasn't God Who Made Honky Tonk Angels” and Hank Thompson's “The Wild Side of Life” making the song a hit all over again in other incarnations.

The original group consisted of Alvin Pleasant ""A.P."" Delaney Carter (1891–1960), his wife Sara Dougherty Carter (1898–1979), and his sister-in-law Maybelle Addington Carter (1909–1978). Maybelle was married to A.P.'s brother Ezra (Eck) Carter and was also Sara's first cousin. All three were born and raised in southwestern Virginia, where they were immersed in the tight harmonies of mountain gospel music and shape note singing.

Throughout the group's career, Sara Carter sang lead vocals; Maybelle sang harmony and accompanied the group instrumentally; on some songs A.P. did not perform at all but at times sang harmony and background vocals and once in a while, lead vocal. Maybelle's distinctive guitar playing style became a hallmark of the group.  In all, various Carter family members were added to varying lineups of the Carter Family, with the final lineup consisting of Helen Carter, Anita Carter, and June Carter Cash.

Reggae,,,,"Christafari are trailblazers, continually pioneering the genre of Gospel reggae in the U.S. and throughout the world. They have performed in 46 states, 50 nations, at two Olympic Games and even before the President of the United States of America. This multicultural 9-member group is lead by vocalist and founder, pastor Mark Mohr. With their blend of traditional roots and contemporary dancehall reggae, they proclaim an uncompromising message of hope and salvation to this lost generation. After two decades, the band is going stronger than ever with a new album and a relentless tour schedule that will have them performing 100 shows in 25 nations. Christafari was founded in 1989 by songwriter, producer, and lead vocalist, Mark Mohr. Raised in a Christian family, Mark strayed from his spiritual upbringing during his teens and turned to hard drugs, alcohol and even growing marijuana. After having an undeniable encounter with God at a youth camp just before turning 18, Mohr re-committed his life to God and took what he now calls his ""Freedom Step"" out of addiction. At that point, his greatest desire was to help others step out of the same bondage that once entangled him. He felt God impressing on his heart to start the first gospel reggae band in America. It would be a counter-cult, drug aversion ministry that used the uplifting sounds of reggae to bring the lost into the light. This fledgling band was birthed just two weeks later at a camp talent show. He initially called the group The Christafarians and then later shortened the name to Christafari (pronounced CHRIST-AH-FAR-EYE) inspired by the Greek word given to a group of people who collectively represent Christ. ""The best advice I was ever given was to go to Bible College so I could be theologically and doctrinally sound,"" says Mark. He studied at BIOLA University in Los Angeles, majoring in Christian Education. During his years at BIOLA, the group continued taking shape as Mark wrote songs for Christafari's first three albums, ""Reggae Worship Vol. 1"" (Frontline), ""Soul Fire"" and ""Valley of Decision"" (Gotee). ""Valley of Decision"" went on to become the best selling gospel reggae album in the history of the genre. "

The group's repertoire has included, during its five-decade career, R&B, doo-wop, funk, disco, soul, and adult contemporary music. Known for their recognizable choreography, distinct harmonies, and flashy onstage suits, the Temptations have been said to be as influential to soul as The Beatles are to pop and rock.
Formed in Detroit, Michigan, in 1960 as The Elgins (not to be confused with another Motown group with the same name), the Temptations have always featured at least five male vocalists/dancers. Having sold tens of millions of albums, the Temptations are one of the most successful groups in music history. As of 2010, the Temptations continue to perform and record for Universal Records with its one living original member, Otis Williams, still in its lineup.
The original lineup included members of two local Detroit vocal groups: from The Distants, second tenor Otis Williams, first tenor Elbridge ""Al"" Bryant, and bass Melvin Franklin; and from The Primes, first tenor/falsetto Eddie Kendricks and second tenor/baritone Paul Williams (no relation to Otis).

C. Cameron. Like its ""sister"" female group, the Supremes, the Temptations' lineup has changed frequently over the years.
Over the course of their career, the Temptations have released four Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles and 14 Billboard R&B number-one singles. Their material has earned them three Grammy Awards, while two more awards were conferred upon the songwriters and producers who crafted their 1972 hit ""Papa Was a Rollin' Stone"".

He has since released four EPs as well as a debut album I've Tried Everything but Therapy (Part 1) in 2023.

Early life
Swims grew up in Conyers, Georgia. His father introduced him to soul music at an early age by way of artists like Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder, and Al Green. Swims' family were football enthusiasts; he had been playing football for ten years when one of his teachers suggested he and a few of his teammates sign up for a musical theater class. The teacher also said he should join the chorus. It was his second year at Salem High School.

At first his mother, Glenna Fox, was unconvinced he should be in the class. Swims noted his height and said he was more likely to get a theater scholarship than to get one in football.

Swims discovered his passion for performance through his high school theater experience, where he performed in musicals including Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat as well as Shakespeare plays. He began playing instruments including piano and ukulele, and watched YouTube videos of singers to help develop his vocal technique. He is also known by former stage name “Theodore Sinks”. This didn’t float so well with audiences, hence the change to Teddy Swims"

Withers worked as an assembler for several different companies, including Douglas Aircraft Corporation, while recording demo tapes with his own money, shopping them around and performing in clubs at night. When he debuted with the song ""Ain't No Sunshine"" he refused to resign his job because of his belief that the music business was a fickle industry and that he was still a novice compared to other acts."

Born and raised in Washington, D.C., Gaye was the son of a storefront minister of a local Pentecostal church and grew up singing in his father's church, later learning to play piano and drums. As a teenager, he discovered doo-wop and joined local doo-wop groups in the D.C. area. After dropping out of school and briefly enlisting in the United States Air Force, he returned to D.C. where he formed the Marquees, who were first discovered by Bo Diddley and later was mentored by Harvey Fuqua, who changed their name to ""Harvey & The New Moonglows"", recording for Chess Records for two years. Later leaving the Moonglows for a solo career as Harvey Fuqua's protege, he settled for work in Detroit labels such as Anna and Tri-Phi Records before joining Motown in 1961.
Initially earning pay as a session drummer and encompassing a three-octave vocal range, Gaye eventually became Motown's top-selling solo artist of the 1960s. He was crowned ""The Prince of Motown"" and ""The Prince of Soul"" because of solo hits such as ""How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved by You)"", ""Ain't That Peculiar"", ""I Heard It Through the Grapevine"" and his duet singles with singers such as Mary Wells and Tammi Terrell.
His early 1970s releases, What's Going On and Let's Get It On paved the way for the concept album format in R&B music in the 1970s while the Let's Get It On and I Want You albums helped influence the quiet storm, urban contemporary and slow jam genres. After a self-imposed tax exile in Europe in the early 1980s, Gaye returned on the 1982 Grammy-Award winning hit, ""Sexual Healing"" and the Midnight Love album. After a violent argument with his father, he was shot dead by him on April 1, 1984.
In 2008, the American music magazine Rolling Stone ranked Gaye at number 6 on its list of the Greatest Singers of All Time, and ranked at number 18 on 100 Greatest Artists of All Time, and he ranked number 20 on VH1's list of 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.

Nu Metal,Metal,"Des Moines, Iowa, USA",Intense,"Slipknot is an American nu metal band from Des Moines, Iowa. Formed in 1995, the group was founded by percussionist Shawn Crahan and bassist Paul Gray. After several lineup changes in their early days, the band consisted of nine members for the greater part of their tenure: Sid Wilson, Paul Gray, Joey Jordison, Chris Fehn, Jim Root, Craig Jones, Shawn Crahan, Mick Thomson, and Corey Taylor. However, the death of Paul Gray on May 24, 2010, left the band with only eight remaining members. Former guitarist Donnie Steele was the band's touring bassist in 2011.

The band is known for its attention-grabbing image; the members wear matching uniforms, have unique masks respectively and have aliases which are simply numbers. The original idea of wearing masks while performing is often attributed to a clown mask that percussionist Crahan would bring to rehearsals when the band first started. The concept developed, and by late 1997, the band decided that every member of the band would wear unique masks and matching jumpsuits. Vocalist Taylor had this to say when questioned about the masks in 2002: ""it's our way of becoming more intimate with the music. It's a way for us to become unconscious of who we are and what we do outside of music. It's a way for us to kind of crawl inside it and be able to use it."" The concept behind wearing matching jumpsuits has been described as a response to commercialism in the music business and led to the idea of assigning the band members numerical aliases. ""Originally, we were just going to wear the jumpsuits  we figured we might as well take that further and number ourselves.  We were basically saying, 'Hey, we're a product!'"" explained Taylor. Their image has been the subject of much criticism, generally thought of as a gimmick to try sell more albums. The band strongly objects to these claims, proclaiming that the masks are used to draw the attention away from themselves as individuals and put it on the music. Several band members have noted that wearing the masks also helps keep their personal lives private. During an interview in 2005, percussionist Fehn went as far as saying it was a ""blessing"" that they do not get recognized.

Slipknot has been the subject of many controversies throughout their career, both for their image and their music. The lyrical content of some of Slipknot's songs has been linked to several violent and criminal incidents. One such case from 2003 involved a pair of young killers who blamed the lyrics from the song ""Disasterpiece"" for their vicious crime. Another from 2006 involved the lyrics from the song ""Surfacing"" being found at the site of a grave robbing. Slipknot deny any responsibility in cases like this and to date have not been proven to be liable in any cases of this nature. In 2008, vocalist Taylor commented on a stabbing in South Africa that Slipknot were linked to, saying: ""obviously, I'm disturbed by the fact that people were hurt and someone died, as far as my responsibility for that goes, it stops there, because I know our message is actually very positive."" Furthering his point by saying: ""there are always going to be mental disorders and people who cause violence for no other reason than the fact that they're fucked up and lost."""
Glam Metal,Metal,"California, USA",Troubled,"Mötley Crüe is an American heavy metal band formed in Los Angeles, California in 1981. The group was founded by bass guitarist Nikki Sixx and drummer Tommy Lee, who were later joined by lead guitarist Mick Mars and lead singer Vince Neil. Mötley Crüe has been described through the years as the World's Most Notorious Rock Band and has sold more than 80 million album copies worldwide, including 25 million in the U.S.

The band members have often been noted for their hedonistic lifestyles, and the persona they maintained. All the members have had numerous brushes with the law, spent time in prison, suffered from alcoholism, long addictions to drugs such as cocaine and heroin, had countless escapades with women and are heavily tattooed. Their ninth studio album, Saints of Los Angeles, was released on June 24, 2008, certified Gold album in January 2012. They are currently writing new material for a tenth studio album.

Mötley Crüe was formed on January 17, 1981 when bass guitarist Nikki Sixx left the band London and began rehearsing with drummer Tommy Lee and vocalist/guitarist Greg Leon. Lee had worked previously with Leon in a band called Suite 19 and the trio practiced together for some time with Leon eventually deciding not to continue. Tommy took over from previous drummer Butch Brusco. Nikki and Tommy then began a search for new members. Sixx and Lee soon met guitarist Bob ""Mick Mars"" Deal. Mars was quickly auditioned and subsequently hired by Sixx and Lee. Although a lead vocalist named O'Dean was auditioned, Lee had known Vince Neil from their high school days at Charter Oak High School in Covina, California and the two had performed in different bands on the garage band circuit. On seeing him perform with the band Rock Candy at the Starwood in Hollywood, California, Mars suggested they have Neil join the band. At first Neil refused the offer, but as the other members of Rock Candy became involved in outside projects, Neil grew anxious to try something else. When Lee made one final appeal to audition, Neil accepted and was hired April 1, 1981. The newly formed band did not yet have a name. While trying to find a suitable name, Mars remembered an incident which occurred when he was playing with a band called White Horse, when one of the other band members called the group ""a motley looking crew."" He had remembered the phrase and later copied it down as Mottley Cru-. After modifying the spelling slightly, ""Mötley Crüe"" was eventually selected as the band's name, with the stylistic decision suggested by Neil to add the two sets of metal umlauts supposedly inspired by the German beer Löwenbräu, which the members were drinking at the time."

Hard Rock,Rock/Pop,"Los Angeles, California, USA",Provocative,"Guns N' Roses is an American hard rock band from Los Angeles formed in 1985. The classic lineup, as signed to Geffen Records in 1986, consisted of vocalist Axl Rose, lead guitarist Slash, rhythm guitarist Izzy Stradlin, bassist Duff McKagan, and drummer Steven Adler. The current lineup consists of Rose, Slash, McKagan, keyboardist Dizzy Reed, guitarist Richard Fortus, drummer Frank Ferrer and keyboardist Chris Pitman. The band has released six studio albums, accumulating sales of more than 100 million records worldwide, including shipments of 45 million in the United States, making Guns N' Roses one of the world's best-selling bands of all time.
Guns N' Roses' debut album, Appetite for Destruction (1987), reached number one on the Billboard 200 a year after its release, on the strength of ""Sweet Child o' Mine"", the group's only single to reach number one on the Billboard Hot 100. The album has sold approximately 30 million copies worldwide, including 18 million units in the United States, making it the best-selling debut album of all time in the US, as well as the eleventh best-selling album in the United States. The success of the debut was followed by the eight-song album G N' R Lies (1988) which reached number two on the Billboard 200. The twin albums Use Your Illusion I and Use Your Illusion II (1991) debuted at number two and number one on the Billboard 200 and have sold a combined 35 million copies worldwide, including 14 million units in the United States. The cover album ""The Spaghetti Incident?"" (1993) was the band's last studio album to feature Slash and McKagan.

It debuted at number three on the Billboard 200 but undersold industry expectations, despite mostly positive critical reception. Classic era members Slash and McKagan both rejoined the band in 2016.
Guns N' Roses has been credited with reviving the mainstream popularity of rock music, at a time when popular music was dominated by dance music and glam metal. Its late 1980s and early 1990s years have been described as the period in which they brought forth a ""hedonistic rebelliousness"" reminiscent of the early Rolling Stones, a reputation that had earned them the nickname ""the most dangerous band in the world"". The band's classic lineup, along with later members Reed and drummer Matt Sorum, was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2012, in its first year of eligibility."
Alternative Rock,Rock/Pop,"Newbury Park, California",Moody,"In early 2012 a mysterious band appeared online. The group, The Neighbourhood, revealed no biographical information, no photos and no backstory, offering only a moody track titled “Female Robbery.” Fans and the press were confounded, scouring the Internet for any information that might lead them to the identity of these musicians. Pieces of the puzzle, some reflecting reality and some not so much, began to emerge. The Neighbourhood were a quintet. They were from California despite the British spelling of their name. They had a second track, “Sweater Weather,” which had an accompanying — and equally dark — video. 

Although The Neighbourhood’s identity remained hazy, it became clear that the music they were making felt transformative to critics and fans alike. The evocative combination of rock instruments with R&B and hip-hop aesthetics seemed, in many ways, revelatory, a reimagining of sounds that seemed to make people clamor for more information with even greater fervor. In April, BBC Radio One DJ Zane Lowe, an early champion of the group, let it slip that The Neighbourhood was the handiwork of musician Jesse Rutherford, a resident of Newbury Park, CA. By early May, as the band unveiled a free, self-released EP titled “I’m Sorry,” it became understood that the identity of this young band was, ultimately, secondary to the music itself."
